Hi, I'm Angela

⚬──────────✧──────────⚬

╰┈➤ I am a current data analyst at a credit card company. I have been here for 1.5 years now and work a lot with SQL, Python, and Snowflake.

╰┈➤ In my spare time, I love rock climbing, weight lifting, and backpacking!

╰┈➤ I got my Master's at Cornell in Industrial Labor Relations, but fell in love with data afterwards!

Stick around for more projects soon!
